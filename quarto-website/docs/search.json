    "text": "6.2 Transformation\nTo determine which transformation I should use, I constructed a Box-Cox plot. To construct the Box-Cox, I first had to build a linear model with the training data. I built the linear model using only the key predictor variable.\n\nmodel0 &lt;- lm(lbxsatsi ~ alq121, data = training_data)\n\nboxCox(model0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter determining that a transformation was necessary with the initial visualization, I calculated a Power Transformation summary on the training set data for the initial linear model.\n\nsummary(powerTransform(model0))\n\nbcPower Transformation to Normality \n   Est Power Rounded Pwr Wald Lwr Bnd Wald Upr Bnd\nY1   -0.3449       -0.33      -0.3892      -0.3006\n\nLikelihood ratio test that transformation parameter is equal to 0\n (log transformation)\n                           LRT df       pval\nLR test, lambda = (0) 245.4018  1 &lt; 2.22e-16\n\nLikelihood ratio test that no transformation is needed\n                           LRT df       pval\nLR test, lambda = (1) 4427.301  1 &lt; 2.22e-16\n\n\nBased on the power transformation summary, it appears that I need to transform the ALT data by taking the inverse and square rooting the ALT values. This transformation makes sense because there is a very long right-handed tail in the data set with high values that are multiple orders of magnitude greater than the smaller values. The inverse square root power transformation also helps to reduce the variance and decreases the impact of extreme values on the variable distribution.\n\ntraining_data &lt;- training_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(sqrinv_alt = (1/(sqrt(lbxsatsi))))\n\nI then re-visualized the training data using the transformed ALT values.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(x = sqrinv_alt)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 12, col = \"white\", fill = \"salmon2\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(x = sqrinv_alt, y = \"\")) +\n    geom_violin() + \n    geom_boxplot(fill = \"salmon2\", width = 0.3) +\n    labs(y = \"\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(sample = sqrinv_alt)) +\n    geom_qq(col = \"salmon2\") + geom_qq_line() + \n    labs(y = \"Observed sqrinv(ALT) (ALT in U/L)\", x = \"Normal (0,1) expectation\")\n\n(p1 / p2 + plot_layout(heights = c(2,1))) | p3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inverse square root transformation greatly improved the distribution of the data and made it conform much more closely to the normality assumptions. However, this transformation would be very difficult to interpret when applying it to the model. Instead of using the recommended inverse square root transformation by the Box-Cox plot, I decided to use an inverse transformation to help control the right-skewness of the data and decrease the impact of the very large ALT values. This inversely transformed data will be what I use for linear modeling.\n\ntraining_data &lt;- training_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(inv_alt = (1/(lbxsatsi)))\n\nAfter re-calculating the transformation, I visualized the inverse transformation fo the ALT data.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(x = inv_alt)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 12, col = \"white\", fill = \"seagreen3\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(x = inv_alt, y = \"\")) +\n    geom_violin() + \n    geom_boxplot(fill = \"seagreen3\", width = 0.3) +\n    labs(y = \"\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(training_data, aes(sample = inv_alt)) +\n    geom_qq(col = \"seagreen3\") + geom_qq_line() + \n    labs(y = \"Observed 1/(ALT) (ALT in U/L)\", x = \"Normal (0,1) expectation\")\n\n(p1 / p2 + plot_layout(heights = c(2,1))) | p3"

    "text": "10.4 Comparing the Models\nBased on the previous two sections with the visualized predictions and the calculated errors, I still prefer the larger model with five predictors. From the visualization, it appears to have a larger positive slope, which would mean that, while it does not closely approximate the ALT outcome, it does approximate ALT somewhat better than the key predictor model. Given the calculation of the summarizing errors, the RMSPE, MAPE, and MAE are all very similar for both models, indicating that both models have almost the same magnitude of error, average relative error as a percentage of actual values, and largest individual prediction errors. Therefore, my conclusion is based on the validated R-squared from the error calculations, and the larger model has a much higher validated R-squared than the smaller model."

    "section": "11.2 Answering My Question",
    "text": "11.2 Answering My Question\nMy initial question for this research project was whether the alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) of participants in the NHANES data set could be accurately modeled by the frequency of alcohol consumption of these participants. Given the results of my two models and that the model with five predictors was a better fit for the ALT outcome, rather than the model with the single, key predictor of alcohol consumption, I conclude that frequency of alcohol consumption alone is not an adequate predictor for ALT outcomes in is population of NHANES participants. This conclusion is limited because the ALT outcome variable was heavily skewed at the beginning of data analysis. This made proper analytical techniques difficult because of the skewness of the data and a lack of interpretable transformations to be applied to the distribution of ALT. While alcohol consumption may be related to ALT levels, it would require more nuanced statistical analysis to determine the relationship between these two variables."

    "text": "11.3 Next Steps\nSince alcohol consumption causes liver damage and liver damage results in an elevated ALT, a logical next step for this analysis would be to restrict analysis of the ALT levels to a group of NHANES participants who have documented liver disease or cirrhosis. In this subset of participants, the effect of ALT may be easier to tease out."

    "text": "11.4 Reflection\nIf I had realized how skewed the data for the ALT outcome variable was and how many high outliers there were in the data, I would have either picked a different variable to analyze, or I would have restricted the ALT values that I was analyzing. I could have asked a different question, such as, does alcohol consumption model levels of ALT in the blood in NHANES participant who are at a low risk for liver damage (i.e.: have a lower ALT value). With this question, I could have restricted the ALT values to the normal physiological range of 7-55U/L. This restriction would have resulted in an outcome variable that had a distribution that was more normally distributed, and therefore it would have been easier to model with various predictors."

    "text": "4.1 The Question\nTo find a good proxy for liver damage, I decided to compare the means of two quantitative variables from the NHANES 2017-2020 dataset. There were 7247 NHANES participants with complete ALT values and 7216 NHANES participants with complete AST values.\nQuestion: Since both elevated ALT and AST are indicators of liver damage and since these variables are collected on each of the participants and can be considered paired samples, do the means of these two enzymmatic markers of liver function closely approximate each other, such that they are not significantly different?\nExpectation: Both ALT and AST are functionally related enzymmatic markers, even though elevated ALT is more characteristic of liver damage. In this case, I expect there to be no significant difference between the means of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase values. If there is no significant difference, this would indicate that either of these variables could be used as a proxy for liver damage in future analysis."

The ALT level was recorded in units/liter. This enzyme is specific to the liver and and elevated serum ALT is an indicator of liver damage.\nThe variable lbxsassi is the aspartate aminotransferase (AST; in U/L) level measured in the blood serum of the NHANES participants.

I think this may be due to the concept that I mentioned earlier that ALT is a more specific indicator of liver damage, and would be more likely to be elevated in a population, compared to AST. Further investigation with these two variables could look into whether there is a correlation between these liver enzymes and history of alcohol use in this NHANES population."

This result indicates that the ALT level in the male participants from the NHANES dataset was significantly higher than that of the ALT level in females, since the 90% CI of the difference in means (-9.13, -7.66) did not include 0. Therefore, I conclude that my expectation was confirmed and, within the NHANES data set, males have a significantly higher ALT level than females. This result may indicate that males in the NHANES data have a higher rate of liver damage. Future analysis could be conducted to determine whether this elevated ALT level is correlated with differences in alcohol use and alcohol history in males and females."

The other effects were not significant. These results indicate that there are most likely differences in ALT levels between different racial/Hispanic origin groups, with the highest levels of ALT in the Mexican American and Other Hispanic groups. This finding will be important for future analysis and could be further explored to see whether there are correlations between higher ALT levels in these groups and patterns of more frequent alcohol consumption."

    "text": "7.1 The Question\nBased on the previous analysis, I then wanted to compare the alcohol consumption habits among the different Race/Hispanic Origin groups defined by NHANES. From the Tukey HSD pairwise comparisons, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) appeared to have the largest effect in comparisons made with the Mexican American and Other Hispanic groups when they were compared with other Racial/Hispanic origin groups. From the apparent elevation in ALT levels in these two groups, I then decided to explore whether there is an association between periods of high alcohol consumption and Race/Hispanic Origin in these groups in questionnaire data from the NHANES 2017-2020 dataset. There were 7853 NHANES participants with Race/Hispanic origin information and 6704 NHANES participants with answers to the question of whether there has ever been a period in their life where they have had 4/5 or more drinks every day.\nQuestion: Considering that ALT can be used as an indicator for liver damage and the elevated ALT levels in Mexican American and Other Hispanic groups from the previous analysis, is there a significant association between Race/Hispanic Origin and having a period of high alcohol consumption in the participants within the NHANES dataset?\nExpectation: Based on the results from Analysis C, I expect that there is an association between the two variables of reporting a period of heavy alcohol consumption and Race/Hispanic Origin."

Since there are more than five observations in each cell, I conclude that the Chi-squared test is an appropriate statistic to assess the possible association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. Given that the p-value is 1.5x10-6 and is much less than 0.05, I conclude that I can reject the null hypothesis, that there is no association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. This test statistic indicates that there is a significant association between these two variables. The Chi-squared statistic is also quite large compared to the Chi-square value needed to achieve significant at p &lt; 0.05 with 4 degrees of freedom (X2 = 9.49), thus reinforcing our conclusion that there is a strong association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. However, there would have to be further analysis to determine the nature of this association and define whether there are specific Race/Hispanic Origin groups that have higher rates of a Period of High Alcohol Consumption."
